```

### Modes

* **Full Codebase**: Combines all files (except those in `.jympignore`).
* **Prompt-Based (AI-assisted)**: Enter your goal, and the AI will select the most relevant files.
* **Manual File Selection**: Use arrow keys and space to select files/folders from a tree view.

### Example

![JYMP Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mahendra189/jymp/refs/heads/main/assets/screenshot1.png)

## .jympignore

Add file/folder patterns to `.jympignore` to exclude them from selection (like `.gitignore`).

## AI Integration

* Uses OpenRouter (OpenAI-compatible) for prompt-based selection. You can set your API key in the code or via environment variable.

## Customization

* Edit `index.js` to change the banner, selection UI, or AI model.
