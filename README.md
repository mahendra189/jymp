## Installation

1. Clone this repo:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mahendra189/jymp.git
   cd jymp
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. (Optional) Make globally available:
   ```sh
   npm link
   # Now you can run `jymp` from anywhere
   ```

## Usage

Run the CLI from your project root:

```sh
node index.js
# or, if linked globally
jymp
```

### Modes
- **Full Codebase**: Combines all files (except those in `.jympignore`).
- **Prompt-Based (AI-assisted)**: Enter your goal, and the AI will select the most relevant files.
- **Manual File Selection**: Use arrow keys and space to select files/folders from a tree view.

### Example
![JYMP Screenshot](assets/screenshot1.png)

## .jympignore
Add file/folder patterns to `.jympignore` to exclude them from selection (like `.gitignore`).

## AI Integration
- Uses OpenRouter (OpenAI-compatible) for prompt-based selection. You can set your API key in the code or via environment variable.

## Customization
- Edit `index.js` to change the banner, selection UI, or AI model.
